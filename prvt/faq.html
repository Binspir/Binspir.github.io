<h3>Q1:Irregular Passcode Solution after updating to Privaut V3.0</h3>
<p>A1:If you have updated to Privault V3.0 and your previous passcode was like -3.14159, please ignore the negative sign and dot, and simply type 314159 instead to enter the app.</p>

<h3>Q2:Data missing after updating to Privault V3.0</h3>
<p>
Firstly, please check whether you previously were using an app with a similar icon like ours, since many users mistake another app for ours and have been sending a lot of query emails mistakenly to us.
</p><p>
Steps: Open Appstore app > tap your account icon > tap purchased > browse all the similar apps you used to download and might have been using for a while.
</p><p>
Secondly, if you confirm you are using this app. Please try to kill and relaunch the app, since there is a very rare chance that your data might not be migrated to V3.0 format correctly. Relaunching the app can re-initiate the data migration process. 
</p><p>
Thirdly, if you were using secondary passcode(previously also known as decoy passcode), your files are still inside the app but you cannot view them for the time being, please wait for the future release that the data migration feature for this account is available.
</p><p>
if you still have such issue, please send us an email and we will follow-up with you for a recovery solution.
